# Topic-Modelling-using-LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
NLP is the Artificial Intelligence branch which has really contributed in problem solving in today's world.
Topic modeling is the process of identifying patterns in text data that correspond to a topic.
If the text contains multiple topics, then this technique can be used to identify and separate those themes within the input text. This technique can be used to uncover hidden thematic structure in a given set of documents.Topic modeling helps us to organize documents in an optimal way, which can then be used for analysis.
One thing to note about topic modeling algorithms is that they donâ€™t need labeled data, like unsupervised learning it will identify the topics on it's own.
Topic modeling is important because it enables the summarization of vast amounts of data, which would otherwise not be possible.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a topic modeling technique, the underlying concept of which is that a given piece of text is a combination of multiple topics.
It is a statistical model that tries to capture concepts and create a model based on them. The model assumes that documents are generated from a random process based on these topics. A topic is a distribution over a fixed vocabulary of words
